AI 管理指令（同样适用于人）

1. Give direction. Describe the desired style in detail, or reference a relevant persona. Whether you’re briefing Claude or a junior designer, “match the energy of Apple’s product pages—minimal, confident, lots of whitespace” is a much better instruction than “make it pop.”
2. Specify format. Define the rules and required structure of the response. If you want bullet points on a deck, tell the AI.
3. Provide examples. Insert a diverse set of test cases where the task was done correctly. Give the AI an example of a piece of content marketing, or series of tweets that worked well in the past.
4. Evaluate quality. Identify errors and rate responses, testing what drives performance. Just like you give your team feedback, don’t publish AI output without a plan to measure outcomes.
5. Divide labor. Split complex goals into steps chained together. This is exactly how you would approach a product launch—writing down all the steps that need to happen and tracking progress on each.

如今，要做成一个产品或开启一个项目，只需要划分好任务，给出清晰的指令，然后监督执行。AI会自动优化prompt很好的完成任务，重要的是我们要给出让AI执行什么任务以及如何执行。抵达成功与否，实际上取决于抵达的过程，要搜集好的examples，定义任务应该如何被完成。
