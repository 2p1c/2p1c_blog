AI管理指令（同样适用于人）
1. Give direction. Describe the desired style in detail, or reference a relevant persona. Whether you’re briefing Claude or a junior designer, “match the energy of Apple’s product pages—minimal, confident, lots of whitespace” is a much better instruction than “make it pop.”
2. Specify format. Define the rules and required structure of the response. If you want bullet points on a deck, tell the AI.
3. Provide examples. Insert a diverse set of test cases where the task was done correctly. Give the AI an example of a piece of content marketing, or series of tweets that worked well in the past.
4. Evaluate quality. Identify errors and rate responses, testing what drives performance. Just like you give your team feedback, don’t publish AI output without a plan to measure outcomes.
5. Divide labor. Split complex goals into steps chained together. This is exactly how you would approach a product launch—writing down all the steps that need to happen and tracking progress on each.
